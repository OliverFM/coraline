A thin wrapper on OpenAI's text-to-speech and speech-to-text to make it relatively easy to use those services.

## Use
If you have cargo and rust installed:
`cargo run` should give you all you need, including help!

### Running on windows
in command prompt in the directory with `coraline.exe`, run `coraline --help` to get started.
Make sure you have run `set OPENAI_API_KEY=yourapikeyhere` so that you have access to the API!
